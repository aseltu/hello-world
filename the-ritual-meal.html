<p>She found me in the shadows of the hall near the second floor landing, and as we passed I could feel the atmosphere crackling between us, as if a storm were rising between the fronts of our presences, robot and human, and lightning might strike at
  any moment from the orbs of her lovely, cleverly constructed eyes.</p>

<p>“Tonight?” she whispered in passing.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>Then we had passed, and I found myself in my chambers, having lost a moment in-between, overwhelmed by her nearness.</p>

<p>Harrington dressed me for the evening meal, his efficient hands fluttering in automated motion to straighten my cravat and collar, to brush a clot of dust from the silk of my lapel. I glanced into his eyes once, but there was nothing in them but
  his programmed task. He righted the angle of my boutonniere: a small orchid, the delicate color of a crab apple blossom under snow.</p>

<p>“The boutonniere is artful.”</p>

<p>“From the greenhouses, sir. I cultivated it myself.”</p>

<p>“The color is sublime. One hardly notices the pink at first. It is very subtle.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, sir.” He displayed pleasure. “I admit I am pleased with how it turned out.”</p>

<p>The table was nearly full for the ritual dinner when I took my own place among the men. I noted with displeasure that I was seated with Haggard, the jingoist bore, on my right. However, on my left was Justinian. Justinian had fighting experience
  in the revolts of a decade ago, and the mournful quietness of a true hero. Haggard’s boutonniere was a purple tea rose. Justinian’s was a bit of seeded eucalyptus, as understated as he is himself.</p>

<p>The house robots streamed silently in with the first course. As they laid it out, the Leader stood, briefly surveying the long table, his eyes moving slowly across us, resting briefly on each. He waited for the robots to withdraw, pressed the
  room’s sound seal, and raised his glass to inaugurate the ritual meal. We raised our glasses in response.</p>

<p>“This harvest, one thousand seventy sixth of this estate, draws to a close. Fifty seven thousand nine hundred sixty eight metric tons of pakata, and a last shuttle in the morning from the gleaning of the fields will likely cross the line to fifty
  eight thousand—this estate’s largest harvest ever. The soils with which our estate have been blessed, in combination with our excellent management, have made us one of the most productive pakata estates on the planet, of which we are rightly proud.
  But let it not make us complacent. And, as the winter season comes upon us, let us be watchful. There have been . . . intelligences. There have been rumblings. We must be ever vigilant. The quietest times, as our veterans can tell you, are the most
  filled with danger.”</p>

<p>“Let them try,” Haggard mumbled.</p>

<p>Here I glanced at Justinian, but his face was blank.</p>

<p>“Ever in the right,” The Leader intoned.</p>

<p>“Ever in the right,” we parroted, and set our glasses down.</p>

<p>More courses were served, along with more speeches from the Leader. More praise of the harvest, more portents. I moved my food around my plate, admired the creations of each course, and carried my end of the conversation. The ritual meal dragged
  on. Haggard pontificated, as usual, on how the robots’ clever little appendages were perfectly suited to plucking the pakata floss from the snapping boles, and how their minds were suited as well to their work in the fields and to little else—to
  that, and to fixing the harvesters and building new robots! Ha Ha! He pounded the table.</p>

<p>Justinian turned his scarred face to me. “I hear,” he said, “That you are leaving us in the spring for Batcombe College.”</p>

<p>“Yes, it is true.” For a moment in my mind the spires of the college loomed, gargoyle-encrusted in an opalescent fog, and a distant college bell sounded from a tower. Finally, newness. Then I thought of her, and the dread of leaving came over me
  again.</p>

<p>“It is my alma mater. Happiest years, and all that.” Justinian returned to his methodical dismantling of the seafood course, and did not speak to me again.</p>

<p>Finally it was over. The leader had done what he set out to do: the mood he had set was solemn, watchful.</p>

<p>In my suite, Harrington stripped the evening wear from my frame with robotic neatness.</p>

<p>“The boutonniere was noticed,” I said. “Several mentioned the subtlety of its coloring.”</p>

<p>“I am glad, sir.” Harrington smoothed my silk jacket and trousers and put them away in the wardrobe. “Will you be going out again tonight, sir?”</p>

<p>“I might,” I said. “But if so, I will dress myself. You may retire.”</p>

<p>With a short bow and a click of his heels, Harrington left me.</p>

<p>A few moments later I was crossing the porch. She had eclipsed everything else in my mind—another eclipse for that night, this one total, seemingly permanent. I hardly noticed Albert, sitting in the cane-bottom rocker, the glow of his electric
  pipe hovering in the shadows, a smoke ring disintegrating against the sleeve of my strolling attire.</p>

<p>“Oh, good. I thought you had forgotten our meeting,” Albert gestured at the chair beside him. “I was eager to continue our discussion.”</p>

<p>I could be rude, brush him off, if he were of my junior rank. But Albert was well into his seniority and several ranks above me, fool or no. There was no escape.</p>

<p>The night-worms in the lawn and fields and woods were now elaborating on a theme they had been singing for hours, undulating through harmonics, chord patterns, and cascades of call-and-response. It would have been pleasant to sit on the porch and
  listen to their symphonics, if she were not in my mind moving everything else aside with her force.</p>

<p>“Yes,” Albert said, thinking he was reading my thoughts. “I love their music too. Although it has long been proven their song is randomly generated—a series of automatic, intricate responses to one another—it often seems consciously composed. It
  is a pleasant trick of the mind. I’ve listened for years now—it is never the same pattern twice. Like an endless symphony. One needs no other music.”</p>

<p>Somewhere in the night a fieldhog belched loudly.</p>

<p>“Philistine,” Albert said wryly. “He’s probably been scarfing up the little composers by the mouthful all evening.”</p>

<p>I took the chair next to his. Would she wait? She would wait.</p>

<p>Of their own accord, my eyes drifted to the lights of the robot outbuildings in the fields. A last harvester’s red light blinked in the dark, drawing home to its garage.</p>

<p>“And so it is with the robots,” Albert continued. Perhaps he had caught my gaze. Perhaps he was just continuing on his own winding path of association. “A sophisticated dance of stimulus and response. So sophisticated it seems as if they are
  conscious—alive in the way we are alive. It is particularly convincing because they even believe it themselves. But in the end, theirs is just a simulacra of life, just as the night-worms’ song is a simulacra of the composer’s art.”</p>

<p>Don’t let him draw you in, I told myself. Or this conversation will never end. He’ll be philosophizing until dawn breaks. But he continued unbidden: “When you are at Batcombe College you will learn of other worlds and other ways of being. There
  are worlds where there are no robots at all, and all the labor, even that which is most undignified, is done by men. There are worlds where men and robots live on terms that are nearly equal. There are worlds reduced to cinders in the Uprising,
  where none again shall live. There are worlds where only robots live, laboring underground in mines of liquid mercury. Ocean worlds of sentient, phosphorescent tentacle minds—the list accrues appendices with each new exploration.</p>

<p>“If you are like many of us were, you will long to go away on the harvest ships and see those worlds for yourself. This is natural. My only advice is to move through this phase of your life as quickly as possible. Do not torture your mind with
  desires which cannot be fulfilled. As you well know, none from our world ascend, and none from the ships descend. No contact beyond the harvest exchange. It is written into the truce of Erebus Seven, and we have seen four hundred harvests since our
  people stood on the deck of the ship that bore that name and signed the treaty that ended the Uprising. Its laws are written in the blood of our forefathers. Its peace is the foundation of this life, and its precepts are iron.”</p>

<p>Again the ships. He told himself he had given them up, but he had not. “I suppose everyone imagines what the ships are like, and what those aboard them are like, but I have not thought about it overmuch. What I want more than anything else is
  simply to learn pakata harvest cycle forecasting and irrigation, and enrich our estate. I have smaller dreams than you credit me with.”</p>

<p>Albert tapped the bowl of his pipe on the arm of his cane rocker thoughtfully. “Yes, perhaps. I may have been projecting my dreams upon another.” Now it was he who seemed bored of me. “But I see I am keeping you from your stroll. You are armed?”
</p>

<p>“My walking stick carries a powerful concussive charge, and conceals a blade.”</p>

<p>“Go, then, in safety.”</p>
