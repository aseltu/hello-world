  <h3 id="the-harvest">The Harvest</h3>
  <p> The harvest ship, low in its geosynchronous orbit, was so enormous it could eclipse the sun. Late in the harvest season, this eclipse would occur a quarter hour or so before true sunset. The descending sun’s orb would warp and flicker in the
    opalescent haze of the ship’s shielding as the hull blotted out its lower edge, then more and more of its globe, and shadow bands wavered across the landscape.</p>

  <p> For a moment the ship’s shade would spread across the world, leaving only the rosy streamers of the sun’s corona in the sky around the teardrop shadow. Then, the sun’s lower arc would begin to bulge, blood-orange, from underneath the hull—as if
    rising again, but now upside down, its rays sputtering and strobing through the ship’s shielding, its curve wavering like heat’s dance atop a road. </p>

  <p> Then, it seemed to rush down from the ship toward the planet’s true horizon. On many days, it dropped down sullenly, bulging as it hit the horizon like a fat fieldhog squeezing itself into its hole. We would turn away then, our silver and bone
    eclipse glasses dangling on their chains, and return across the immaculately tended lawns to our estate. But on some days its fire, refracted everywhere in atmospheric moisture, dust, and clouds, would tessellate the sky in garnet, persimmon,
    cinnabar and tangerine, and some of us would linger.</p>

  <p> This sunset had been particularly beautiful. I had stayed to watch the shifting blush saturating the clouds and sky until the colors paled to gray-blue and violet. In the lawn and in the fields the night-worms began to sing, raising their
    little stalk-bodies, opening their orifices wide, and sighing their wavering chords into the gloom. </p>

  <p> Under their worm-song I could hear the drums of the robots in the distance, calling the straggling harvesters in from the fields. A scattering of lights bobbed through the denuded pakata stalks, far down the hill. The robots were barely
    harvesting anymore: now it was gleaning, capturing the last of the valuable boles, trying to leave nothing of the harvest behind to freeze in the winter. A few more days and the harvest ship would depart. The festivals would begin, followed by
    the snows: the languid season, the time for repairs and for the regaining of strength before spring planting. </p>

  <p>I had thought I was alone on the lawn, but Albert was there, with his long face and bulbous eyes that always reminded me, unpleasantly, of an insect. He was still gazing up at the sky. The harvest ship’s shields still caught a bit of light from
    the sun. It hung, rosy crescent of a second moon, clouds drifting across its shadow. </p>

  <p> “And while we dream of being on a harvest ship,” Albert said, “moving from one planet to another, they are looking down at our planet from up there, wondering what it is like to be born here, to know real soil under your feet, the gravity of a
    planet, the seasons created by atmosphere, orbit and axial tilt, the pleasures of a rain shower, the first snow. They know nothing of the boredom we sometimes feel, trapped in the cycle of seasons, of planting and harvest. And we know nothing of
    the boredom they feel—the boredom of constant travel, of the darkness between worlds, of knowing you came into the world and will leave it without ever feeling a planet beneath your feet.” He glanced at me, meaningfully. “We all want what we
    cannot have, don’t we? Whether fleetingly, or with an ache that cannot be resolved.”</p>

  <p>“I’ve never wanted to be on a harvest ship.”</p>

  <p>“No, perhaps not.” Folding his loose-jointed arms behind his back, he joined me in my walk up the lawn toward the estate. Where we stepped, the worms withdrew into the earth, their chords growing still in rings around us, rippling pools of
    quietude through which we moved. Albert continued: “That was my particular desire. I should not project it onto you. When I was young, I drew the harvest ships. I filled many a book with them—fantasy, cutaway views of their engines, their
    rotating pleasure decks, my imagined staterooms. I would draw myself as well—long-limbed and interplanetarily elegant in my uniform. There are young ones, I am sure, up there, drawing our estate houses, our chambers, our harvest scenes, the
    robots at their work in the fields. They also want what cannot be theirs. You are young. You feel this type of longing still, I am sure. If not to be on the harvest ships then—for other things that cannot be had. Such is natural in youth. I’ve
    long ago put such thoughts away.”</p>

  <p>We were nearing the estate now, its porte-cochere, its screened veranda wrapping around all sides, its towers and cupolas of volcanic stone veined and streaked with moss and ivy, its dormer and casement windows lit with candescent glow. We were
    now on the curved gravel drive. I found myself viewing the estate, where I have lived my whole, ordered life, as a child on a harvest ship would view it. And for a moment it did seem a place of fantasy, where stories were shaped and drama
    occurred.</p>

  <p>“Perhaps,” I said with caution, feeling for the safest words. “I suppose we all feel such things, at times.”</p>

  <p>“Will you join me on the veranda for a pipe, following the ritual meal?”</p>

  <p>Meaning he would want to reminisce more, I supposed. Or probe my own business further. But there was no escaping it. “Yes.”</p>

  <p>“Good!” And with that Albert quickened his pace a bit, in that gangly, adolescent fashion he can suddenly take on, half-running under the porte-cochere, up the stairs, and through the doors.</p>

  <p>I lingered for a moment in the worm-song, then went in.</p>
