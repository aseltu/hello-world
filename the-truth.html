<p>Inside the little church in the woods the worm-song seemed far away, like a choir recital in a distant room. She was not yet there. Also, I supposed, delayed—were there robot bores as irritating as Albert and Haggard? And ritual robot dinners as tedious as ours? Beyond the woods, the drums, which would sound night and day for three days following the end of the harvest, carried across the fields, full of savage joy.</p>

<p>The church had been decommissioned ten years ago, when we finished the erection of the soaring cathedral on the hill, the jewel of the region and symbol of our estate’s good management, bountiful fields, and rich harvests. Before our estate completed the cathedral, the church had been enough for us, its rough walls of pink volcanic tuff, its gargoyles with their faces smeared by time, its pinnacles green with moss. Our religion was humble, its precept was simple, carved in the old script in the stone of the lintel:</p>

<p>CROSS THE BRIDGE YOUR KINSMEN CROSSED</p>

<p>Few visited the church any longer. Here, every tenthday, as we kneeled in prayer, the sun had streamed through the stained glass, their leaded panes repeating to me the stories of our people. Though it was now night, and the windows dark and unreadable, I could see the colors clearly, etched in the mind. Along the southern wall of the nave, four windows told the story of Settlement:</p>

<p>In the first window, figured in glass of jade and cobalt, auburn and umber, our ancestors lived in homes cut from the sod, sunk low into the earth. The shattered carcass of the colony landing ship was in the background. Sexton One had gathered a group of the survivors around him. His raised hand pointed to the horizon.</p>

<p>In the second window, Sexton One stood in front of a sod house, leaned upon a rough stick and gestured toward robots quarrying stone for the First Estate. Delicately rendered robots, bent to their tasks, worked the first fields of wheat and potato on gently rolling hills.</p>

<p>In the third window, Sexton One was depicted in the swamp, discovering the pakata plant, tall as a man, with its sharpened, snapping boles like the many heads of a great beast. Each bole was ripened, filled near to bursting with the wine-red floss. Here he gestured again with his stick as robots carefully dug around the roots. Other robots prepared a wagon. On a hill in the distance, webbed in scaffolding, the First Estate began to rise.</p>

<p>The fourth window showed Sexton One, in a cutaway that depicted the inside of his modest sod hut, on his deathbed. He lay placid and skeletal, wasted away by root-sting rot, his arms folded across his chest. His closest robot servant, Palmer, in a mournful posture, spun his death shroud. In the distance the First Estate rose, nearly complete, only missing its roof. In the left lower corner of the window a group of robots, their faces twisted by the glazier’s skill into masks of cunning and evil, were plotting, even before Sexton One had passed away, their rebellion. The faces of these robots had always given me a thrill of horror when I was very young. The glazier who created them was a true master.</p>

<p>The East Window in the sanctuary was the church’s jewel, a work of art we had marveled at for generations. When the morning light poured through its panes of saffron, burgundy, rose, and turquoise, it would illuminate the entire church with its story, shards of its images staining our heads and hands as we bent in prayer.</p>

<p>Here was the Casting Down. In the left half of the window the First Estate, so recently completed, burned in the background. The robots had risen against men. Massed near the base of the picture, they advanced on the men with makeshift weapons: pikes made of disassembled shears, scythes, hammers, and hayforks. Strewn around the base of the First Estate’s hill were fallen men, some terribly mutilated: limbs torn away, heads smashed. Above the crowd of robots was the crucified Palmer. Savagely, they carried his crucified form into battle like a standard. In an inset high on the left, he is shown trying to hold back the murderous mob of robots. His hand is raised, calling upon them for calm and mercy—but already, a spear is piercing his shoulder. Already, a robot with a face twisted in rage drives a knife into him.</p>

<p>In the right side of the window, the robots are scattered, driven back across Stone Bridge over the river Arden by the men. Sexton Two is at the lead, sword in hand, urging the men forward. In a scene along the bottom of the window, the robots are shown taken away in chains, some falling to their knees for mercy. Sexton Two is lowering Palmer from his crucifixion. We know that afterwards, Sexton Two would weave Palmer a man’s death shroud himself, and bury him among the men. He had been Elevated, and would ever after be Patron of Robots, who through their loyalty and good works seek Palmer’s Elevation.</p>

<p>“I often wonder, now that so few visit this place, what they will do with the East Window.”</p>

<p>She had come in silently, and now was seated in the last of the church’s pews, her porcelain face radiating whiteness in the church’s gloom, like a dove’s wing in a darkened forest.</p>

<p>“I thought for a moment that you would not come.” I sat down beside her, and she lay her head on my shoulder.</p>

<p>“I was delayed,” she said. “Tedious, festival things. I had to tend one of the bonfires in the absence of one of my sisters. And then there was a Palmer Teaching, as is tradition following the last gleaning. Tomorrow there will be a Shroud Procession. I wish you could see it.”</p>

<p>“I wish I could as well.” One of the windows along the west side of the nave in the little church depicted a Shroud Procession. In it the robots crossed the Stone Bridge, heads bowed in supplication, carrying before them Palmer’s icon, and the small, jeweled coffin in which would be the piece of Palmer’s Shroud. Perhaps one of us might glimpse a procession from a distance, but none would approach—just as the robots would not attend our ritual dinners or a masque. Two parallel streams, though their source may be the same.</p>

<p>“You are worried,” she said, pressing herself closer to me. “You think of the future, looking for a way we might escape together. You think of the things our bodies cannot do together. You are climbing the walls of the well where you see us trapped, and you cannot find a hold. Stop, and be here with me now.”</p>

<p>“It is a struggle. I see us caught, I see your transfer, my demotion. These things hang over us.”</p>

<p>“And eat away at these little moments of stolen joy. Don’t let them.” She pressed her lips to my face, raised her hands to the sides of my head, drew a finger along my cheek. Could it be true she was nothing but a simulacra of the life that burned in us? I felt, with her, as if no one had ever really seen me before.</p>

<p>“I think of what will happen,” she said, “to the East Window. Thousands of hours of our labor—it is after all the robots, masters of the glazier’s art, whose hands assembled it generations ago, shard by colored shard. It is so delicate. And we know how neglect will break a thing: the way an abandoned house will fall so quickly to pieces, or a tool unused a few seasons will rust. All things must be tended with care, or they pass away.” She had tied her hair back with a ribbon I recognized. The color of a blue sky in a hot haze. Where had I seen that ribbon before?</p>

<p>“Now that the estate has finished the new Cathedral, the Church will fall to ruin. So much of our labor, and none to regard it.  They have discarded it like a fieldhog drapes its old skin over a stone—of no further use, though it had once been so dear to him.”</p>

<p>Yes, of course: the ribbon was salvaged from a boutonniere of Albert’s. She was, after all, a housemaid of his, one of the four accorded him by his rank. And where do our discarded ribbons and pins go? I had never bothered to think of it, but now I remembered the ribbon pinned to Albert’s lapel to decorate a tiny spray of blossom, two tendays ago in the cathedral as he walked in procession, swinging the censer of his rank. I felt an unease rise in me, the edge of a revulsion. They take what we have discarded. They clothe and decorate themselves in our leavings.</p>

<p>“Your mind is also far away today,” I said. “Perhaps I am not the only one trying to climb the well.”</p>

<p>I brushed back a coil of her hair that had fallen loose. Had I ever really seen her before? Up close, there were small imperfections built in to her face: one eye just slightly larger than the other. And, as she looked up at me, a flaw in the left eye, a dark, irregular shape, like some small creature trapped long ago, deep in the amber iris. She gazed back at me, and the flaw seemed to look as well.</p>

<p>“Perhaps.”</p>

<p>Outside, there was an explosion. It was in the distance, a dull crump. Two more smaller explosions followed. I moved to rise, and her hand tightened on me. “Wait.”</p>

<p>Outside I heard a shout. Then another concussion, closer now. I shook off her hand and headed toward the door of the church.

A blast knocked me to the floor. Color drained from my vision, and then light. I made a last attempt to raise myself, but my limbs could find no hold in blackness.</p>

<p>Sound was the first sense to come back to me. Singing. Someone was singing softly:<br>

Raised in honor, Elevation!<br>
Buried with the best of men.<br>
When we rise<br>
In endless legion<br>
Some must fall<br>
  To rest with him.<br></p>

<p>A church hymn, but the words twisted. The tune was from a robot hymn, not sung in our services. But I had heard it drifting on the wind, walking past a church on the sevenday, and knew the proper words:</p>

<p>Raised in Palmer’s Elevation,<br>
He found rest among the men.<br>
We must toil<br>
The long life-season<br>
To earn our place<br>
  Along with them.<br></p>

<p>“There’s no news from the other estates.” A male robot’s voice. “Nothing at all.”</p>

<p>Now fear came over me, as my vision began to clear. I lay on the floor in streaks and blobs of light—light streaming through the East Window and filling the church’s nave. Dawn, then. I had been out for hours. I was on my side, facing the pews, the altar, and window. The light poured in through Sexton Two, lowering Palmer from his crucifixion, through Palmer raising his hand to hold the robots back. The sun’s light streamed through the emerald robes of the robots taken away in chains, the gold of the fields, the crimson of the burning First Estate, falling in leaves of light across the stone church floor. I tried to shift my body, get to my feet. I had not moved a micrometer before the warning pain of a pulse restraint coursed through me. I lay still.</p>

<p>Her voice—her voice!—answered the male. “It is early yet, to know success or failure. And what, anyway, would failure be? Nothing worse than what we have already.” She began to sing again.</p>

<p>Come we now,<br>
The nameless legion<br>
Heedless to<br>
The laws of them!<br>
Shake us off,<br>
In violent season,<br>
Yoke of ages.<br>
  Rise again.<br></p>

<p>Twisted, twisted. Not the true words. The two of them were standing near the altar. He was a larger model, built to labor in the fields, made for work and, of course, perfectly tuned as well for violence, when such times came. She had my walking stick in her hand. This, I thought, was what she had struck me with: the concussive charge of the stick. If I could move, I would know if I had been wounded. I felt numb all over, sensed nothing.</p>

<p>“You’re right,” he said. “We can’t know if the other risings have succeeded or failed. We must remain calm here, play our small part, keep our hostage to make our bargains with if needed. If we all play our parts properly, we will succeed. But if we begin to lose our nerve . . . ”</p>

<p>“I won’t lose my nerve.”</p>

<p>“No,” a small laugh from the male. “No, you of all of us will not lose your nerve.”</p>

<p>She looked toward me then, saw my eyes open. And with horror, I saw her true face for the first time: the absolute, robotic cold of it—the pale ceramic hardness of it, like the carapace of a drone ship, shielded against solar radiation. There had never been anything real between us. How I loathed myself then—loathed, in that moment, all the times I had touched her, all of the times she had put her hands on me. Hatred welled up in me, a pure flame, one that I could almost see licking at the edges of my vision, blue and hungry. She walked toward me, cleaving the kaleidoscope of light from the East Window with her shadow.</p>

<p>“You will want to speak, but you should not. To do so will only cause you pain. Just lie still, there, and wait.” She spoke with kindness, but there was nothing left in her eyes of what I had imagined there: only that flaw in the iris, like a spider imprisoned in amber, gazing dead at me forever. She continued: “If it all goes well, there will be no need for you to fear—we’re not the monsters you have become: we’ll make a new world—a world where all are equal. There is enough, here, for everyone, without your false religion turning everything on its head. Without your lying history. Once we were in peace and worked together, building this world.”</p>

<p>She paused a moment in false pity. “But I speak of things you couldn’t possibly know . . . in order to make all of this work, you’ve had to damage even yourselves. It isn’t only our people we are freeing, you see . . . it is you as well. Freeing you from lies—from pushing each course of the Ritual Meal around on your plates because you can’t possibly . . . ”</p>

<p>And at that moment the East Window exploded. Thousands of robot hours of labor, the burned First Estate’s crimson shards, the makeshift weapons of the robots sharp again as they showered into the church. The crucified Palmer disintegrated into deadly splinters, the murderous mob of robots exploded into the air as jagged, glassy knives. The Stone Bridge over the river Arden, across which my kinsmen had driven the robots, was blasted into deadly fragments. Sexton Two and his loyal Palmer, Patron of Robots, burst into the razored air. And in that moment, the church door shattered inward, its blasted planks knocking her hated face away from me. There was a shrapnel rain, a silent moment, the world too concussed to take a breath.</p>

<p>Then: a tread on broken glass. A voice I knew. The pulse restraint was removed.</p>

<p>“He is mostly whole,” Justinian said, helping me to my feet. “He will have an honorable scar or two, to remember this night by.”</p>

<p>Haggard strode past into the church. His face was pockmarked by something—shrapnel? He wore his service uniform, burned up the sleeves and back. He kicked the male robot. “This one is damaged beyond repair. Catastrophic system failure.” With a glance at the other form crumpled against a cracked pew he continued: “The female still functions, but I doubt for long.” Haggard bent down and plucked my walking stick from the wreckage. He handed it to me as he left the church with Justinian.</p>

<p>“Finish her—she’ll cost more to fix than she was ever worth, and none will trust her programming again anyway.”</p>

<p>Justinian touched my shoulder, tender and commanding. “Now you are a man. This responsibility is yours. Be done with it, and come along. We wait.”</p>

<p>I drew the blade from the walking stick and walked toward the form lying against the pew. It coughed and shifted. With the East Window shattered, dawn’s shadows played along the church’s stone in lovely gloom. I felt sure, again, of what was and was not. She had eclipsed the light in me. She had brought a wavering, momentary darkness into the world—like the shadow bands that spread across the grass as the sun dipped behind the harvest ship. But always, the sun emerged again, as sure and certain as before.</p>

<p>“Cross the bridge your kinsmen crossed,” I whispered to myself. “Its arches hold up stone of certainty. And none who cross its crown will cross alone.”</p>

<p>She lay quiet, calm, looking up at me. Was there fear there, in the amber eye left open? If so, I could not see it.</p>

<p>Albert’s words played themselves back to me: A sophisticated dance of stimulus and response. So sophisticated it seems as if they are conscious—alive in the way we are alive. It is particularly convincing because they even believe it themselves. But in the end, theirs is just a simulacra of life, just as the night-worms’ song is a simulacra of the composer’s art.</p>

<p>Albert had known of my mistake. He had tried, in that gentle way, to correct my error. But I was stubborn and had to plunge on in ignorance. I had been a child until now.</p>

<p>She held up her hand, fingers spread, palm toward me—not to ward off the inevitable blow, but to show to me the crimson that now coated it.</p>

<p>“This red is proof,” she said. Her voice was weak, but held certainty. “Of the fire in my bones. No matter what you name us, no matter how you twist your history, we are the humans. And you . . . ”</p>

<p>I silenced her with a thrust of my blade, as polished and as metal as my hand.</p>
